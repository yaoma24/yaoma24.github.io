<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>This course is intended for senior undergraduate students who are interested to
gain hands-on experience applying computational techniques to solve big data
analysis problems. Examples of such problems include: How to detect trending
topics in Twitter data? How to predict customers who would churn to a
competitor? How to design a large-scale recommender system? Students will learn
the basic techniques and programming tools that can be used to provide answers
to such questions. </p>
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To  introduce the basic concepts and methods for big data analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>To teach programming skills and tools for collecting, storing, querying, and
analyzing large-scale data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Students will have a good understanding of the capabilities provided by various data analysis techniques and apply the appropriate ones to solve real-world
problems</p>
</li>
<li><p>Students will gain hands-on experience on using data analysis tools</p>
</li>
<li><p>Students will gain experience designing and developing programs for collecting, querying, and analyzing data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prerequisite and Background</h2>
<p>CSE 331 and CSE 335 and STT 351. Students should demonstrate a basic
understanding of algorithms and data structures and methods to create reliable
programs. Students must have working knowledge of abstract data types and
classes. Such background is needed to ensure that students can understand the
sample programs provided in class and able to write their own programs for
homework assignments and class project. An integral part of the course is the
Hadoop distributed computing platform, which is written in Java programming
language. Thus, familiarity with data abstraction, classes, and object-oriented
concepts (such as inheritance and polymorphism) will be needed. </p>
<h2>Preference Books</h2>
<p>There is no main textbook for the class. Lecture notes will be posted online
and are based on materials from the following books:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduction to Data Mining (Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach, and Vipin
Kumar), Addison Wesley, 2006</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mining of Massive Datasets (Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman), Cambridge University
Press, 2011</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide (Tom White), O'Reilly Media, Fourth Edition,
2015</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Outline</h2>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> for more details</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data collection, querying, and preprocessing (3 weeks)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overview of data analysis techniques (4-5 weeks)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implementation (5-6 weeks)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Case studies and applications (1 week)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Assessment </h2>

<h2>Course Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Homework assignments are due before midnight on the due date. Late submissions will
be deducted 25% of the total possible assignment grade (if submitted after the
deadline but on the same day) or 50% (if submitted a day after the deadline).
Assignments submitted more than one day after the deadline will not be accepted
(unless you receive permission from the instructor). </p>
</li>
<li><p>Weekly lab exercises are due before midnight on the due date. The three lowest
grades for the lab exercises will not be included when calculating your final
grade.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are encouraged to form study groups to learn the materials in class.
However, all submitted assignments (including computer programs) must be your
own work. If plagiarism is detected, the students involved will automatically
receive a 0 for the grade and will be reported to the university. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The instructor reserves the right to modify the course content and class
schedule during the semester.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make-ups for examinations may be arranged if your absence is caused by
documented illness or personal emergency. A written explanation (including
supporting documentation) must be submitted to your lecture instructor; if the
explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged.
When possible, make-up arrangements must be made in advance. </p>
</li>
<li><p>All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system
provided for this course. Account usage guidelines published by the Department
of Computer Science and Engineering are posted at
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/facility/policy.php">http://www.cse.msu.edu/facility/policy.php</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>The Department of Computer Science expects all students to adhere to MSU's
policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades. Information about MSU policy
regarding academic integrity is available at
<a href="https://www.msu.edu/~ombud/academic-integrity/index.html">https://www.msu.edu/~ombud/academic-integrity/index.html</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Students who require accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) with MSU's Resource Centers for Disabilities (RCPD) should bring their
Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form to the
instructor at the beginning of the semester as possible.</p>
