<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>This course will cover the fundamental topics in data mining including classification, clustering, association analysis, and anomaly detection. The course is aimed towards graduate students who are interested to do research in data mining, machine learning, and other related disciplines.
Students are expected to have programming background either in C, C<tt></tt>, Java, Python, or other equivalent programming languages in order to do the homework assignments and class project. Some of the homework assignments may require programming in Matlab. Students are also expected to have background in algorithms and data structures, linear algebra, and probability/statistics.</p>
<h2>Preference Books</h2>
<p>There is no main textbook for the class. However, you may use materials from the following books as a reference. Lecture slides and additional reading materials will be provided on the class website.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduction to Data Mining (Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach, and Vipin
Kumar), Addison Wesley, 2006</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mining of Massive Datasets (Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman), Cambridge University
Press, 2011</p>

<h2>Course Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Homework assignments are due before midnight on the due date. Late submissions will
be deducted 25% of the total possible assignment grade (if submitted after the
deadline but on the same day) or 50% (if submitted a day after the deadline).
Assignments submitted more than one day after the deadline will not be accepted
(unless you receive permission from the instructor). </p>
</li>
<li><p>Weekly lab exercises are due before midnight on the due date. The three lowest
grades for the lab exercises will not be included when calculating your final
grade.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are encouraged to form study groups to learn the materials in class.
However, all submitted assignments (including computer programs) must be your
own work. If plagiarism is detected, the students involved will automatically
receive a 0 for the grade and will be reported to the university. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The instructor reserves the right to modify the course content and class
schedule during the semester.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make-ups for examinations may be arranged if your absence is caused by
documented illness or personal emergency. A written explanation (including
supporting documentation) must be submitted to your lecture instructor; if the
explanation is acceptable, an alternative to the examination will be arranged.
When possible, make-up arrangements must be made in advance. </p>
</li>
<li><p>All students are expected to be responsible users of the computer system
provided for this course. Account usage guidelines published by the Department
of Computer Science and Engineering are posted at
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/facility/policy.php">http://www.cse.msu.edu/facility/policy.php</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>The Department of Computer Science expects all students to adhere to MSU's
policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades. Information about MSU policy
regarding academic integrity is available at
<a href="https://www.msu.edu/~ombud/academic-integrity/index.html">https://www.msu.edu/~ombud/academic-integrity/index.html</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Students who require accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act
