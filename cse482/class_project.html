<p>As part of the course requirement, students are required to complete a class
project. The class project accounts for 10% of your final grade. Each project
can be done individually or in groups of 2 or 3 students. </p>
<p>There are four components to the project:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Data collection and preprocessing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li><p><s>Development of a web-based prototype system that uses the results of data
analysis.</s> Any demo that can show the results of the data analysis will be sufficient. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Project reports (see the details about what report to submit below).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Students working individually are required to complete steps 1, 2, and 4 only.
Students working in groups of 2 or 3 students must also complete step 3. The
timeline and deliverables for the project are as follows. All deliverables are
due before midnight on the due date:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>October 12, 2017</b>: Email the instructor a 1-2 pages project proposal. The
proposal must contain the following information: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Project title along with a list of team members</p>
</li>
<li><p>List of data sources that will be used (provide a URL for the data). State
whether the data needs to be further preprocessed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A short abstract describing the goals of the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Role of team members (who will be responsible for doing what).</p>
</li></ol>
</li>
<li><p><b>November 7, 2017</b>: Email the instructor your project intermediate report. The
report must contain the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Project title along with a list of team members</p>
</li>
<li><p>A detailed abstract (less than 250 words) describing the goals of the
project, what you plan to do, what data sets you will be using, what are the
challenges that may arise and how you plan to solve them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project timeline (what you have accomplished so far and what you still need
to do).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Role of team members (who will be responsible for doing what).
Note that at this point, you are expected to have completed the data collection
and preprocessing.</p>
</li></ol>
</li>
<li><p><b>December 7, 2017</b>: Email the instructor your final project report. You could find a sample of
the final report here: <a href="project/sample.doc">sample.doc</a>. Make sure you
submit a zip file that includes the source code as well (you don't need to
submit the raw data). If you are hosting the project on a non-CSE server,
make sure you make the web site accessible until December 27, 2017.</p>
</li>
</ol>
