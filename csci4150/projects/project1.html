<h1>Project 1: Search in Pacman</h1>
</div>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>This project is part of the <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa25/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>CS 188 projects</a> created by John DeNero, Dan Klein, Pieter Abbeel, and many others.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
</p>
<p>The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore. You can download all the code and supporting files, <b>including the autograder</b> in <a href="https://rpiexchange-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/may13_rpi_edu/IQA0HKRUwOzDTJ2KKmczyd_5ARj2zasqrhYSnBOTUsCKI84?e=IYP56H" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>search.zip</a>.

<h3>What to submit</h3>
<p>You will fill in portions of <tt>search.py</tt> and <tt>searchAgents.py</tt> during the assignment. You should submit these two files (only).
</p>
<h3>Evaluation </h3>
<p>Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please <b>do not</b> change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation &ndash; not the autograder's output &ndash; will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.
</p>
<h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don't let us down.
</p>
<h3>Getting Help </h3>
<p>You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help. Office hours and Submitty forum are there for your support; please use them. If you can't make our office hours, let us know and we will schedule more. We want these projects to be rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know when or how to help unless you ask. One more piece of advice: if you don't know what a variable does or what kind of values it takes, print it out.
</p>
<h2>Welcome to Pacman</h2>
<p>After downloading the code (<a href="https://rpiexchange-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/may13_rpi_edu/IQA0HKRUwOzDTJ2KKmczyd_5ARj2zasqrhYSnBOTUsCKI84?e=IYP56H" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>search.zip</a>), unzipping it and changing to the search directory, you should be able to play a game of Pacman by typing the following at the command line:
</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>python pacman.py
</p>
</div></div>
<p>Note: if you get error messages regarding <tt>python-tk</tt>, use your package manager to install <tt>python-tk</tt>, or see <a href="http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>this page</a> for more detailed instructions. Pacman lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty round treats. Navigating this world efficiently will be Pacman's first step in mastering his domain.
</p>
<p>The simplest agent in <tt>searchAgents.py</tt> is called the <tt>GoWestAgent</tt>, which always goes West (a trivial reflex agent). This agent can occasionally win:
</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>python pacman.py &ndash;layout testMaze &ndash;pacman GoWestAgent
</p>
</div></div>
<p>But, things get ugly for this agent when turning is required:
</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>python pacman.py &ndash;layout tinyMaze &ndash;pacman GoWestAgent
</p>
</div></div>
<p>If pacman gets stuck, you can exit the game by typing <tt>CTRL-c</tt> into your terminal. Soon, your agent will solve not only <tt>tinyMaze</tt>, but any maze you want. Note that <tt>pacman.py</tt> supports a number of options that can each be expressed in a long way (e.g., <tt>&ndash;layout</tt>) or a short way (e.g., <tt>-l</tt>). You can see the list of all options and their default values via:
</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>python pacman.py -h
</p>
</div></div>
<p>Also, all of the commands that appear in this project also appear in <tt>commands.txt</tt>, for easy copying and pasting. In UNIX/Mac OS X, you can even run all these commands in order with <tt>bash commands.txt</tt>.
</p>
<h2>Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Search Algorithms</h2>
<p>In <tt>searchAgents.py</tt>, you'll find a fully implemented <tt>SearchAgent</tt>, which plans out a path through Pacman's world and then executes that path step-by-step. The search algorithms for formulating a plan are not implemented &ndash; that's your job. As you work through the following questions, you might need to refer to this glossary of objects in the code. First, test that the <tt>SearchAgent</tt> is working correctly by running:
</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch
</p>
</div></div>
<p>The command above tells the <tt>SearchAgent</tt> to use <tt>tinyMazeSearch</tt> as its search algorithm, which is implemented in <tt>search.py</tt>. Pacman should navigate the maze successfully.
Now it's time to write full-fledged generic search functions to help Pacman plan routes! Pseudocode for the search algorithms you'll write can be found in the lecture slides. Remember that a search node must contain not only a state but also the information necessary to reconstruct the path (plan) which gets to that state.
</p>
<p><b>Important note</b>: All of your search functions need to return a list of actions that will lead the agent from the start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves (valid directions, no moving through walls).
</p>
<p><b>Hint</b>: Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* differ only in the details of how the fringe is managed. So, concentrate on getting DFS right and the rest should be relatively straightforward. Indeed, one possible implementation requires only a single generic search method which is configured with an algorithm-specific queuing strategy. (Your implementation need not be of this form to receive full credit).
</p>
<p><b>Hint</b>: Make sure to check out the <b>Stack</b>, <b>Queue</b> and <b>PriorityQueue</b> types provided to you in <b>util.py</b>!
