<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Graph structured data such as social networks and molecular graphs are ubiquitous in the real world. It is of great research importance to design advanced algorithms for representation learning on graph structured data so that downstream
tasks can be facilitated. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize the deep neural network models to graph structured data, pave a new way to effectively learn representations for graph-structured data either from the node level or
the graph level. Thanks to their strong representation learning capability, GNNs have gained practical significance in various applications ranging from recommendation, natural language processing to healthcare. It has become a hot
research topic and attracted increasing attention from the machine learning and data mining community recently. This tutorial of GNNs is timely for AAAI 2020 and covers relevant and interesting topics, including representation learning
on graph structured data using GNNs, the robustness of GNNs, the scalability of GNNs and applications based on GNNs.</p>
